I wrote this because I keep seeing people writing text-based adventure games which have
one function per room. This is a demonstration of how one should separate code and data
instead.

Apart from that, it isn't particularly good code, I wrote it in the minimum possible time.
If you want to do it properly, read Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code" and then do it in
Java.
